## Difficulty: easy - medium

This is a coding challenge for full-stack developer applications applying under Fauzi Assegaff. You may complete as much challenges as necessary in sequence within the time window given.

- Setup this project as a git repository and structure the branches and commits properly.
- Start the challenges by navigating, build and run whats inside the packages/webapp and see the available code challenges on your browser.
- Continue to use the code that has been provided, and may add any necessary lite moduels/library when it deems necessary.
- Use of typescript is highly encouraged.

### Challenge 1: Functional test
- [ ] The penguin can be clicked, ane each click will add the love meter up to 5.

- [ ] Setup the whole project as a git repository even without the remote
- [ ] Able to demonstrate how standardize dev ops, commits and brach merging



## Evaluation:

- Whole source code should well structured as a single monorepo project.
- Dockerfile setted up and CI/CD deployment ready in one of the continuous build providers.
- Use type-check/strict mode / lint and app should build / minified without any errors.
- Code can easily recognized and speak for itself.
- The quality of the codes varies on how you demo and represent the code to the interviewer.
- Testing with React Testing Library and/or Cypress/PhantomJS/mocha is a plus.
- All fulfilled optional options on the challenges is a plus.
